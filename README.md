<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About

Setting up an API server is a daunting exercise with authorization, doc generated from source, helmets and other safe props.
So I created a template, that way one can kick things off almost right away.

<div align="center">
   <a href="#">
      <img src="public/apply-creatures-logo.png" alt="screenshot" width="60%">
   </a>
</div>

## Features

* REST APIs
* Authentication
* OpenAPI Doc generation and Swagger UI
* RedDoc generation from API specs
* Postgres integration
* (some) unit tests

Of course, nothing is perfect, but I will try to keep this up to date and fix issues right here. If I failed in accomplishing that, shoot me a message.
If you've truly tried everything and still can't get this to work for you, try to reach out. Or raise an issue. But I make no promise

### Built With

- [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - of course
- [feathersjs](https://feathersjs.com/) - never did before, I almost used another one, but it seems solid
- [sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - because it simplifies interfacing with a DB, and abstracts which kind of DB that is
- [winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) - for better logging

### Also using

- [OpenAPI](https://www.openapis.org/) - To nicely document the API interfaces
- [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) - Because it reads more like real documentation  
- [biome](https://biomejs.dev/linter/) - that keeps my code well formatted

<hr/>

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- you need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
- and [nodejs](https://nodejs.org/) of course
- [postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) installed

### Set up repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/apply-creatures/creature-api-boilerplate.git
```

Navigate to the repo root's folder & install dependencies

```bash
$ cd ./creature-api-boilerplate && npm install
```

### Develop

**Start postgres**

you may also want to create the database or the server may crash at startup 

```sh
psql -U postgres -h localhost
CREATE DATABASE creature_api_boilerplate;
```

**Launch in develop mode**

```bash
$ npm run develop # code changes will automatically reload the server
```

**Access via browser**

- Hit [http://localhost:3030](http://localhost:3030)

### Build

This command will compile for production deployment:

```bash
$ npm run compile
```

It generates the files as js for node to execute directly, yeah Nodejs doesn't understand Typescript.

Then you can:

```sh
npm run start:prod
```

But if you are truely in production as this point you may need to check the Docker container [file](./Dockerfile) and the compose [here](./docker-compose.yml) which would spin up a postgres and the server. 

### Deploy

To host the server, better use a container. Or you may try that but check what it's doing first.

```bash
$ npm run deploy
```

_you should really look at the scripts in [package.json](./package.json), search for "scripts".

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

### Adding an endpoint

An endpoint is a service.

- Look at an exiting hook in the [services](./src/services/) folder 
- Create your own service, or add a function to an existing one
- Make sure to document your endpoint via swagger annotation
- Verify it works and that the doc and schema's alright

### Adding a model

You may want to store stuff in a DB. for that create a model for your entities.
If you spread direct connections in your service, it will be hard to keep things DRY. And, you may seriously sabotage potential desires to switch to another type of DB down the road. And you will ending writing more code than you need to. Instead:

- Look at an existing model in the [models](./src/models/) folder
- Figure it out

<hr/>

## Roadmap

- [x] Setup a repo with an API framework -> feathersjs
- [x] Setup all the whistle, helmet with headers, CORS, serving static welcome page, logger
- [x] Add a bit of midlayer, some endpoint with some models
- [x] Sequelize to hook this up to a DB (mostly for auth)
- [x] Setup auth, username/password and JWT, dahell with social
= [x] Swagger - I think that's done, maybe more spec propoerties but that's enough
- [x] Fix auth - creating users with encrypted password works, but for some reason logging in with password does not work
- [x] ReDoc from swagger spec
- [x] Serve some static landing page with links to docs
- [x] Some env variable for DB settings
- [ ] More testing
- [ ] More I guess

Don't forget to give the project a star! Thanks again!

1. fork the Project
2. create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/some-feature`)
3. commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`)
4. push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/some-feature`)

## Acknowledgments

It would never end. I've done this work not just off dozens of other people's open source work, but hundreds thousands or maybe millions.
Special kudo to the gatsby team that made such an easy tool to build static websites, the pipeline and community is awesome.

Whoever made markdown, although that was probably inspired by some other cool markups languages, thank you.

the js community, millions of developers made the npm ecosystem so rich one can build virtually anything with node.

If you decide to re-use this repo to build your own stuff, go ahead. No need to credit or link back to this repo/site. Although it would be appreciated.
**Don't re-republish stuff pretty much as is though**, it is lame, and shameless.
Tweak it, make it your own. Make it so that I wouldn't come across your stuff  and think that it is mine. So that nobody comes across your stuff and somehow finds out it's a louzy copy of someone else lacking added value and personalisation.
